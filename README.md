This is an educational project that converts an infix mathematical expression (e.g., 3+6-(8/4)%2) to its postfix version and evaluates it.
It also works for decimals.
In case the input is not numeric and is parametric, the application will produce its function and draw its graph using JavaFX.
For infix to postfix conversion structure.Stack data structure is needed that is manually designed is this application.
